Fuel Consumption Analysis using Linear Regression
Overview:

This repository delves into fuel consumption data analysis using both simple and multiple linear regression models. We aim to uncover the relationships between various factors (independent variables) and fuel consumption (dependent variable).

Data:

The provided dataset, fuel_consumption.csv, includes the following features:

MODELYEAR: Model year of the car
ENGINESIZE: Engine size of the car
CYLINDERS: Number of cylinders
TRANSMISSION: Type of transmission
FUELTYPE: Type of fuel
DRIVEMODE: Type of drive mode
CITYMPG: Fuel consumption in the city (miles per gallon)
HWYMPG: Fuel consumption on the highway (miles per gallon)
COMBMPG: Combined fuel consumption (miles per gallon)
CO2EMISSIONS: CO2 emissions (grams per mile)
Analysis and Modeling:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

We'll load and explore the dataset for initial understanding.
Missing values and outliers will be addressed as needed.
Visualizations will be used to explore the distribution of numerical variables.
We'll check for potential correlations between variables.
Simple Linear Regression:

A simple linear regression model will be built to predict CO2EMISSIONS using ENGINESIZE as the predictor.
Model performance will be evaluated using R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
The regression line and scatter plot will be visualized.
Multiple Linear Regression:

We'll construct a multiple linear regression model to predict CO2EMISSIONS considering multiple features like ENGINESIZE, CYLINDERS, FUELTYPE, and DRIVEMODE.
Similar performance metrics will be used for evaluation.
The model's coefficients will be analyzed to understand the impact of each feature on CO2EMISSIONS.
